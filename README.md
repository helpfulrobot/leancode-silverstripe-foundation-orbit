Silverstripe Carousel Module
============================

Image slider module for the Silverstripe CMS based on foundation theme.

## Author
This module was created by leancode(Dominic O'Brien) based on the code from the Carousel module created by [i-lateral](http://www.i-lateral.com).

## Installation
Install this module either by downloading and adding to:

[silverstripe-root]/orbit

Then run: http://yoursiteurl.com/dev/build/

Or alternativly add to your projects composer.json

## Usage
Once installed, you must add the template variable $OrbitSlides to any templates you require a carousel to appear on.

Then, you can setup a slide show by logging into the admin interface and editing the page you want to add a orbit slide show to.

Then click the "Settings" tab, and tick the "add slide show" checkbox.

Once this is done (and you have saved) you will see a width and height overwrite appear (allowing you to change the size of your slide show).

Once you have finished configuring, you can go back to editing you page, and a "orbit" tab should have appeared in the right hand site of the editing pane.
